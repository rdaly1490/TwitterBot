# TwitterBot
This Twitter bot was built to continuously check the Oculus Rift Twitter feed for any mention of pre-order availability and send my phone a text mesage of that tweet when it happens.

### To Start:
1. npm install
2. Create a Keys folder with a keys.js file to put your unique credentials into (twilio, twitter api, phone numbers)
3. cd into directory
4. run 'node oculus'

Congrats, you now have the bot running locally on port 3000.
Play around with the values, add to it, subtract from it, and have fun!
