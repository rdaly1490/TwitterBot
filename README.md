# TwitterBot
This Twitter bot was built to continuously check the Oculus Rift Twitter feed for any mention of pre-order availability and send my phone a text mesage of that tweet when it happens.

### To Start:
1. cd into directory
2. npm install
3. Create a Keys folder with a keys.js file to put your unique credentials into (twilio, twitter api, phone numbers)
4. run `node oculus`

Congrats, you now have the bot running locally on port 3000.
Play around with the values, add to it, subtract from it, and have fun!

Oh, and follow me on Twitter:
